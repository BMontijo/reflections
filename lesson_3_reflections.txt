When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all of your work 
local?

Using a remote repositiory would be beneficial in a variety of circumstances. It 
can be used for off-site backup of your projects, allow you to work on your project 
from different computers, allow for multiple collaborators in your office or around 
the world.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

When collaborating you may not want to have everyone's changes being incorporated
all the time. With manual pulls you can control when you pull changes and incorporate
them to your local copy.

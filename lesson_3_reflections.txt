When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all of your work local?

Using a remote repositiory would be beneficial in a variety of circumstances. It can be
used for off-site backup of your projects, allow you to work on your project from 
different computers, allow for multiple collaborators in your office or around the
world.

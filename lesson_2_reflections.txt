What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Initializing a repository sets it up to be used by/with git. Adding the .git folder 
which would allow for cloning and commiting changes and allowing tracking of file 
changes. You need to do it for the availability of version control and so git 
would know the directory as a working one and to follow the changes made to the 
project.

What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Initializing a repository sets it up to be used by/with git. Adding the .git folder 
which would allow for cloning and committing changes and allowing tracking of file 
changes. You need to do it for the availability of version control and so git 
would know the directory as a working one and to follow the changes made to the 
project.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is a place for changes to be made can wait until they are ready 
to be committed. The working directory will already have the changes made, while
the repository will be waiting for changes. The staging area allows to to pick
and choose what will be committed.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

As long as you know the files you have changed you can stage only the files that have
changes that make a logical commit and commit those while leaving other changed files
for another commit.
